							<p>"I've always been interested in the Sci-Fi genre. While I enjoy movies of all kinds, Sci-Fi is where I spend most of my time. Like Blade Runner, dystopian future movies are usually what I am most interested in"<br>

							<h3>Blade Runner</h3>
							<article style="margin: 2%;">
								<h3>Synopsis</h3>
								<p>In the early twenty-first century, the Tyrell Corporation, during what was called the Nexus phase, developed robots, called "replicants", that were supposed to aid society, the replicants which looked and acted like humans. When the superhuman generation Nexus 6 replicants, used for dangerous off-Earth endeavors, began a mutiny on an off-Earth colony, replicants became illegal on Earth. Police units, called "blade runners", have the job of destroying - or in their parlance "retiring" - any replicant that makes its way back to or created on Earth, with anyone convicted of aiding or assisting a replicant being sentenced to death. It's now November, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), a former blade runner, is called out of retirement when four known replicants, most combat models, have made their way back to Earth, with their leader being Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer).</p>

								<h3>Blog post</h3>
								<p>Through out the movie we are given small bits of information that could point to Deckard (Harrison Ford) being a replicant. We are never fully given an answer to whether he is or not</p>
								<hr>
								<p>The Blade Runner that is shot at the beginning of the movie actually survives. This scene was cut from the theatrical version, leaving us in the dark what happens to him.</p>
								<hr>
								<p>A sequel to Blade Runner was finally released, in 2017. The sequel follows a replicant known as K, who is used to hunt down and "retire" older model replicants. A certain character from the original movie, makes an interesting appreance! </p>

							<h3>Aliens</h3>
							<article style="margin: 2%;">
								<h3>Synopsis</h3>
								<p>57 years after Ellen Ripley had a close encounter with the reptilian alien creature from the first movie, she is called back, this time, to help a group of highly trained colonial marines fight off against the sinister extraterrestrials. But this time, the aliens have taken over a space colony on the moon LV-426. When the colonial marines are called upon to search the deserted space colony, they later find out that they are up against more than what they bargained for. Using specially modified machine guns and enough firepower, it's either fight or die as the space marines battle against the aliens. As the Marines do their best to defend themselves, Ripley must attempt to protect a young girl who is the sole survivor of the nearly wiped out space colony.</p>

								<h3>Blog post</h3>
								<p>When Fox execs saw an early cut of the film, they complained to producer Gale Anne Hurd that it looked like the money had all been spent on sets rather than special effects. Hurd took great delight in telling the execs that a majority of the sets that they were seeing in the film were indeed miniatures or optical effects (eg, special effects). The artists behind these images were very pleased that their work had fooled the money men</p>
								<hr>
								<p>Aliens is the second movie of a franchise that ends up spanning well over 5 movies!</p>
								<hr>
								<p>Ripley(Sigourney Weaver)is very stand-offish towards the android, because of the android in the original movie going crazy and trying to kill the crew members</p>

								<p>The sports car Harry and Lloyd purchase is a Lamborghini Diablo. Supplied courtesy of Emich Lamborghini, Golden, Colorado - which has since closed down.</p>
								<hr>
								<p>A sequel was released decades later. As a huge fan of the first, I just pretend the sequel was never made. Yes, it's that bad</p>
								<hr>
								<p>This movie was made and released when Jim Carrey was at his peak. Some of his other movies released at the time were: Liar, Liar and Ace Ventura.</p>
